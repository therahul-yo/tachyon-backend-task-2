# Task Manager Frontend (Vite + React)

## Setup
1. Install Node.js (v18+ recommended)
2. From this folder:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. By default the frontend expects backend at http://localhost:4000. To change, set VITE_API_URL in your environment.

This UI is intentionally minimal and styled with a dark, modern aesthetic. Use Tailwind or design system if you want to upgrade further.
